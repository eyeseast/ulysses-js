However, the sailors foolishly opened the bag while Odysseus slept, thinking that it contained gold. All of the winds flew out and the resulting storm drove the ships back the way they had come, just as Ithaca came into sight. They were blown back to Aiolia, where Aeolus refused to provide any further help because he thought Odysseus was unlucky. ",
